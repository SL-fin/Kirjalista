# Kirjalista

Works by first asking the user what they want to do from the five different options ( add book, delete book, view all books, view books by genre and view books by either writer or book name.)
after choosing you will be prompted with the dialog for each category, for example for adding a book you will get asked questions on what the name genre ect are. for deleting you will be asked only the name. Viewing automatically shows all your books, viewing genre will ask you to give it a genre to look for. This is the same with writer/bookname category.
